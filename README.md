# Basic C SDL2 project : Tunisia flag

This project is a basic C [SDL2][SDL] project that uses [CMake][] as a build system.<br>
It draws the flag of [Tunisia][] using basic graphics primitives.

It could be used as a base to draw any other flag with SDL2. Just fork it,
clone it and execute the `rename_project.sh` script. You will be prompted to
enter the new project name, the new executable name and the new git repository,
but you can keep the autodetected values. Finally, just commit and push the
result to your repository.

## Dependencies

- [Git][]
- C Compiler (gcc, ...)
- [CMake][]
